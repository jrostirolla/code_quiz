/*
How it will work: BRAINSTORM
- Have a basic card that has the information for the desired moment in time
    - Start with intro screen (see framework for reference)
    - When start button pressed, the JS file overwrites the text in the card with the desired information
        - TODO: Basically, one way for this to work, you can have separate cards which are hidden until called (create boxes first, each with own ID. Each ID set to hidden until called)
        - TODO: OR, you can have the JS rewrite the contents of each card so that it in turn shows the contents you wish to show (WARNING! this options seems more complicated, ABORT!!!)
        - Have a <h2> with card info ("Welcome", "Question", "Highscore", etc)
        - Have <p> with the intro info and the instructions, which is collapsed and hidden when the "start" button is pressed
        - Have buttons, or internal boxes, that are hidden on initial page load, then loaded when start button pressed
        -
